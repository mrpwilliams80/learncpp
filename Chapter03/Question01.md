# Chapter 03
## Question 01

### The following program is supposed to add two numbers, but doesnâ€™t work correctly. Use the integrated debugger to step through this program and watch the value of x. Based on the information you learn, fix the following program:

<br>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int readNumber(int x)
{
	std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
	std::cin >> x;
	return x;
}

void writeAnswer(int x)
{
	std::cout << "The sum is: " << x << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	int x {};
	readNumber(x);
	x = x + readNumber(x);
	writeAnswer(x);

	return 0;
}
```

<br>

### ANSWER
The function read number does not need a parameter. Instead it should declare a variable to store the value obtained through `std::cin >> x;`. Then, in main, the result of readNumber() should be assigned to the variable x.

I realised this by looking directly at the code, before running the debugger. I shall try to avoid doing this for the next question. 

<br>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int readNumber()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int x {};
	std::cin >> x;
	return x;
}

void writeAnswer(int x)
{
	std::cout << "The sum is: " << x << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	int x {};
	x = readNumber();
	x = x + readNumber();
	writeAnswer(x);

	return 0;
}
```
