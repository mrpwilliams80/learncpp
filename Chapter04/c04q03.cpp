 * @brief   Write the following program: The user is asked to enter 2 floating 
 *          point numbers (use doubles). The user is then asked to enter one of 
 *          the following mathematical symbols: +, -, *, or /. The program 
 *          computes the answer on the two numbers the user entered and prints 
 *          the results. If the user enters an invalid symbol, the program 
 *          should print nothing. Example of program:
