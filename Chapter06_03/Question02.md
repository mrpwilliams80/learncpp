## Question 02

### What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and lifetime? By default, what kind of scope and duration do local variables have (and what do those mean)?

<br>

### ANSWER

- Variable's scope is the section of code it can be used in.
- Variable's duration is when it is destroyed.
- Variable's lifetime is the time creation and destruction.

Local variables have block scope and duration, it means they are destroyed at the end of the block where they were created.

*__NOTE__: If the precise definitions ever prove important, I will have to memorise these. I get the general idea, but not the specific terminology.*
